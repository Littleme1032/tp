### Ui and Parser
<ins>Overview</ins>

The Ui component, `AppUi` manages user interactions by displaying messages and receiving input. 

The Parser component, comprising `DateParser` and `InputParser`, handles input parsing to interpret commands and dates entered by the user accurately

<ins>Implementation</ins>

- **Class Diagram**: Displays the relationship between `AppUi`, `DateParser`, and `InputParser`. `AppUi` serves as the main interface for user interaction, utilizing `DateParser` and `InputParser` to interpret and process input effectively.
  - {Input Class diagram}
- **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates the flow of processing user input, from capturing input in `AppUi`, parsing it with `InputParser`, and validating date formats via `DateParser`.
  - {input sequence Diagram}

#### Ui Component

<ins>Overview</ins>

The `AppUi` class in the Ui component facilitates user interactions, including displaying start up messages, errors, and capturing input from users.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

- **Attributes**:
  - `scanner`: `Scanner` — Reads user input from the console

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

*Class Diagram*: Illustrates `AppUi` with its methods for displaying messages and capturing user input.

{insert class diagram for UI Component here}

<ins>Methods</ins>

- **displayWelcomeMessage()**: Outputs a startup message.
- **getUserInput()**: Reads input from the user.
- **showUnknownCommandMessage()**: Notifies the user of an unrecognized command.
- **showErrorMessage(String message)**: Displays a specific error message.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

```
AppUi ui = new AppUi();
ui.displayWelcomeMessage();
String userInput = ui.getUserInput();
ui.showUnknownCommandMessage();
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

- **Future Extension**: Additional Ui features such as graphical interfaces or web-based interactions may be added to enhance user experience.

#### Parser Component
<ins>Overview</ins>

The Parser component includes `InputParser` and `DateParser`. `InputParser` processes user commands, while `DateParser` validates date string.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

- **Attributes**:
  - `formatter`: `DateTimeFormatter` — Defines a date format for parsing.

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

*Class Diagram*: Shows `InputParser` parsing command input and `DateParser` handling date validation.

{insert class diagram for Parser Component here}

<ins>Methods</ins>

- **InputParser.parseCommands(String input)**: Breaks down commands and arguments.
- **DateParser.parse(String dateStr)**: Validates and converts date strings.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

```
HashMap<String, String> commandArgs = InputParser.parseCommands("add /date 12/10/24 /amount 500");
LocalDate parsedDate = DateParser.parse("12/10/24");
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

- **Future Extension**: To support more complex commands and argument parsing, the Parser component could introduce additional parsers, such as `CommandParser` and `ArgumentParser`, extending from an abstract base. Supporting alternative date formats in `DateParser` could enhance flexibility, accommodating user input from different locales or formats.

### Logic
<ins>Overview</ins>

The Logic component manages core functionalities in the application like adding, editing and deleting financial entries. 
It interacts with `FinancialList`, `AppUi` and `Storage`, and leverages command classes (`AddExpenseCommand`, `AddIncomeCommand`, etc.) to execute operations.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

- **Attributes**:
  - `financialList`: `FinancialList` — Stores financial entries.
  - `ui`: `AppUi` - Manages user interactions.
  - `storage`: `Storage` - Handles data persistence

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

*Class Diagram*: Shows Logic as the main controller interacting with `FinancialList`, `AppUi`, and various command classes for operations (e.g., `AddIncomeCommand`, `DeleteCommand`).

{Insert Class Diagram for Logic Component here}

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The Logic constructor initializes `FinancialList`, `AppUi`, and `Storage` components to support all operations.

<ins>Methods</ins>

- **executeCommand(String userInput)**: Parses and executes the command from `userInput`.
- **addExpense(double amount, String description, LocalDate date, Expense.Category category)**: Adds a new `Expense` to `FinancialList` specified or default category.
- **addIncome(double amount, String description, LocalDate date, Income.Category category)**: Adds a new `Income` to `FinancialList` specified or default category.
- **deleteEntry(int index)**: Removes an entry at a given index.
- **editEntry(int index, double amount, String description, String date, Enum<?> category)**: Updates an entry's amount, description, date and category.
- **seeAllEntries()**: Displays all entries in `FinancialList`.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

```
FinancialList financialList = new FinancialList();
AppUi ui = new AppUi();
Storage storage = new Storage();

Logic logic = new Logic(financialList, ui, storage);
logic.addIncome(500.00, "Freelance Project", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 27));
logic.seeAllEntries();

```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

- **Future Extension**: External APIs could be integrated in the future for features like currency conversion or market updates, making Logic an ideal candidate for adaptability.

### FinancialList and FinancialEntry
<ins>Overview</ins>

Managing financial entries through two main components:

- **FinancialList**: A centralized data structure that stores and manages entries. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to handle financial records, such as adding new entries and modifying or retrieving existing ones.
- **FinancialEntry**: An abstract base class representing a generic financial record. Subclasses include `Income` and `Expense`, which inherit shared attributes like `amount`, `description`, and `date`. Each with specific characteristics and categories that distinguish income from expenses.

<ins>Implementation</ins>
- **Class Diagram**: Displays the relationship between `FinancialList`, `FinancialEntry`, `Income`, and `Expense`. It highlights `FinancialList` as the main container managing `FinancialEntry` objects.
  - {Input Class diagram}
- **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates the process of adding a new entry, from parsing user input to creating and adding the entry to `FinancialList`.
  - {input sequence Diagram}

#### FinancialList Component
<ins>Overview</ins>

The `FinancialList` component is the primary data structure responsible for managing all financial entries, specifically `Income` and `Expense`. It provides methods to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **retrieve** entries, serving as the application’s central entry manager.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

- **Attributes**:
  - `entries`: `ArrayList<FinancialEntry>` — Stores both `Income` and `Expense` instances.
  - `totalExpenseByCategory`: `Map<Expense.Category, Double>` — Tracks expenses by category.
  - `totalIncomeByCategory`: `Map<Income.Category, Double>` — Tracks income by category.

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

*Class Diagram*: Show `FinancialList` managing `FinancialEntry` objects (`Income` and `Expense` subclasses).

- **Constructor**: Initializes an empty list of entries to support CRUD operations.
  - **Key Arguments**: None

<ins>Methods</ins>

- **addEntry(FinancialEntry entry)**: Adds a `FinancialEntry` object to `entries` in ascending date order.
- **deleteEntry(int index)**: Removes an entry at the specified index.
- **editEntry(int index, double amount, String description, LocalDate date, Enum<?> category)**: Updates the `amount`, `description`, `date`, and `category` of a specified entry.
- **getEntry(int index)**: Retrieves a `FinancialEntry` at the specified index.
- **getEntryCount()**: Returns the total count of entries in the list.
- **getTotalExpenseByCategory()**: Returns a map of expense categories with their respective totals.
- **getTotalIncomeByCategory()**: Returns a map of income categories with their respective totals.
- **getHighestExpenseCategory()**: Retrieves the highest expense category and its total, with ties resolved alphabetically.
- **getHighestIncomeCategory()**: Retrieves the highest income category and its total, with ties resolved alphabetically.
- **clearCategoryTotals()**: Clears all category totals for both expenses and income.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

```
FinancialList financialList = new FinancialList();
Income income = new Income(500.00, "Freelance Project", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 27), Income.Category.SALARY);
Expense expense = new Expense(50.00, "Groceries", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 28), Expense.Category.FOOD);

// Adding entries
financialList.addEntry(income);
financialList.addEntry(expense);

// Edit an entry
financialList.editEntry(1, 55.00, "Groceries & Snacks", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 29), Expense.Category.FOOD);

// Retrieve an entry
FinancialEntry entry = financialList.getEntry(0);
System.out.println("Description: " + entry.getDescription());
System.out.println("Amount: $" + entry.getAmount());
System.out.println("Date: " + entry.getDate());

// Display total expenses by category
System.out.println("Total Expense by Category: " + financialList.getTotalExpenseByCategory());

// Get and print highest expense category
Map.Entry<Expense.Category, Double> highestExpenseCategory = financialList.getHighestExpenseCategory();
System.out.println("Highest Expense Category: " + highestExpenseCategory.getKey() + " with $" + highestExpenseCategory.getValue());
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

- **Future Audit and History Management**: To improve traceability and accountability, `FinancialList` could maintain a history log of changes (e.g., edits, deletions, additions). This could support undo operations or provide users with an audit trail of modifications to their financial entries.
- **Security and Access Control**: Adding access control features to `FinancialList` could protect sensitive data. Methods for role-based access (e.g., view-only, edit permissions) could be introduced, along with data encryption for secure storage and retrieval.

---

#### FinancialEntry Component
<ins>Overview</ins>

`FinancialEntry` is an abstract base class that represents a generic financial record. It defines shared attributes such as `amount`, `description`, and `date`, which are common across both `Income` and `Expense`. `Income` and `Expense` inherit these properties and methods, each adding specific functionality related to its type.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The class diagram above shows `FinancialEntry` as the base class with `Income` and `Expense` as specific implementations.
- {Input Class Diagram here}

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

- **Attributes**:
  - `amount`: `double` — Represents the monetary value of the entry.
  - `date`: `LocalDate` — The date associated with the transaction.
  - `description`: `String` — A description identifying the entry.
  - `category`: An `Enum` - A value representing either Income.Category or Expense.Category, specifying the type of each entry.

- **Constructor**: Initializes `amount`, `description`, `date`, and subclasses set their specific category.

  - **Key Arguments**:
    - `double amount`: Monetary value for the entry.
    - `String description`: Description or label for the entry.
    - `LocalDate date`: Date of the entry.
    - `Enum<?> category`: Represents the specific category for either income or expense.

<ins>Methods</ins>

- **Core Methods** (inherited by both `Income` and `Expense`):
  - `getAmount()`, `getDescription()`, `getDate()`, `getCategory()`: Accessor methods for each attribute.
  - `setAmount(double newAmount)`, `setDescription(String newDescription)`, `setDate(LocalDate newDate)`, `setCategory(Enum<?> category)`: Mutator methods for updating values.

- **Custom Methods for Income and Expense**:
  - **toString()**:
    - `Income`: Returns formatted string as `[Income] - description $amount (on date) [category]`.
    - `Expense`: Returns formatted string as `[Expense] - description $amount (on date) [category]`.
  - **toStorageString()**:
    - `Income`: Formats as `"I | amount | description | date | category"` for storage.
    - `Expense`: Formats as `"E | amount | description | date | category"` for storage.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

The following code segment demonstrates the creation of `Income` and `Expense` entries:

```
Income income = new Income(500.00, "Freelancåe Project", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 27), Income.Category.SALARY);
Expense expense = new Expense(50.00, "Groceries", LocalDate.of(2023, 10, 28), Expense.Category.FOOD);

System.out.println(income.toString());
System.out.println(expense.toString());
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

- **Abstract Base Class**: The design decision to make `FinancialEntry` abstract enables extensibility, allowing for new types of financial records without modifying `FinancialList` or existing subclasses.

### Commands

<ins>Overview</ins>

The abstract class `Command` has been implemented to introduce an additional layer
of abstraction between the `CommandHandler` class and command execution,
allowing for separation of handling command keywords and executing commands.

The diagram below shows the inheritance of the `Command` class. The diagram is only meant to show
the hierarchy of classes and have been greatly simplified.

![Command_Inheritance_Diagram](UML/CommandInheritance.png)

<ins>Constructor</ins>

The `Command` constructor updates the attributes based on the input arguments.

<ins>Methods</ins>

The abstract `Command` class and its related children classes have the following method:

- *execute*: Effect the command based on the corresponding child class.

### Adding Entries

<ins>Overview</ins>

The feature to add entries is facilitated by the abstract class `AddEntryCommand`.
The `AddExpenseCommand` and `AddIncomeCommand` classes extend from the `AddEntryCommand`,
and are used to add expenses and incomes respectively.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `AddEntryCommand` class has the following attributes:
- *amount*: An object representing the amount of money in the transaction.
- *description*: An object representing the description of the transaction.
- *date*: An object representing the date on which the transaction occurred.
- *category*: Specifies the category of the entry for income or expense.

The `AddExpenseCommand` and `AddIncomeCommand` classes inherit all attributes
from the `AddEntryCommand` class and have no additional attributes.

The `AddExpenseCommand` and `AddIncomeCommand` classes have the following method:
- *execute*

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to add entries by entering the following commands:
- `expense [DESCRIPTION] /a AMOUNT [/d DATE] [/c CATEGORY]` for adding an expense
- `income [DESCRIPTION] /a AMOUNT [/d DATE] [/c CATEGORY]` for adding an income

This is parsed by the InputParser, returning a HashMap `commandArguments`, containing the
following arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the description of the entry. The value can be left blank.
- `/a`: Represents the amount of money in the transaction. This is a compulsory argument.
- `/d`: Represents the date on which the transaction occurred. If this argument is not used,
  the current date is used. An exception occurs if this argument is used but the value is left blank.
- `/c`: Category of the transaction, defaulting to UNCATEGORIZED if unspecified or invalid.

### Deleting Entries

<ins>Overview</ins>

The feature to delete entries is facilitated by the `DeleteCommand`. Both `Income` and `Expense`
entries can be deleted using this single command.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `DeleteCommand` class has the following attribute:
- *index*: An integer representing the position of the entry in the financial list that is to be deleted.

The `DeleteCommand` class has the following method:
- *execute*: Removes the specified entry from the `FinancialList`.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to delete entries by entering the following command:
`delete INDEX`.

This command is parsed by the `InputParser`, returning a HashMap `commandArguments` containing the
following argument:
- `argument`: Represents the index of the entry in the financial list to be deleted.
  This is a compulsory argument.

When executed, the `DeleteCommand` removes the entry at the specified index from the `FinancialList`,
updating the list and storage.

### Editing Entries

<ins>Overview</ins>

The feature to add entries is facilitated by the `EditEntryCommand`. Both `Income` and `Expense`
can be edited using this one class.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `EditEntryCommand` class has the following attributes:
- *index*: An object representing the index of the entry in the full financial list.
- *amount*: An object representing the amount of money used in the transaction.
- *description*: An object representing the description of the transaction.
- *date*: An object representing the date on which the transaction occurred.
- *category*: New category of the transaction.

The `EditEntryCommand` class has the following method:
- *execute*

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to add entries by entering the following command:
`edit INDEX [/des DESCRIPTION] [/a AMOUNT] [/d DATE] [/c CATEGORY]`.

This is parsed by the InputParser, returning a HashMap `commandArguments`, containing the
following arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the index of the entry in the full financial list.
  This is a compulsory argument.
- `/des`: Represents the description of the transaction. This is an optional argument.
- `/a`: Represents the amount of money used in the transaction. This is an optional argument.
- `/d`: Represents the date on which the transaction occurred. This is an optional argument.
- `/c`: Represents the category used in the transaction. If an invalid category is provided, the entry will default to UNCATEGORIZED. This is an optional argument.

### Listing Entries
<ins>Overview</ins>

The list entries feature is facilitated by the `SeeAllEntriesCommand` class.
The classes `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` extend from `SeeAllEntriesCommand` 
and facilitate listing out expenses and incomes respectively.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `SeeAllEntriesCommand` class has the following key attributes:

- _start_: The starting date from which Financial Entries are to be listed. `null` if there is no starting date.
- _end_: The ending date up to which Financial Entries should be listed. `null` if there is no ending date.

The `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` classes inherit these attributes from `SeeAllEntriesCommand`.

The `SeeAllEntriesCommand` class has the following key methods:

- `execute`: Executes the command, listing all entries/expenses/incomes between the start and end date,
calculating the total cashflow/expenditure/income during that interval and retrieving the category with the highest
expenses/income amount during that interval.
- `shouldBeIncluded`: determines if an entry in the Financial list should be listed out.
- `getHighestCategoryInfo`: retrieves the category with the highest expenses/income within the stipulated date range
and the amount of expense/income in that category.

The `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` classes inherit all the aforementioned methods, overriding
the following methods:

- `shouldBeIncluded` to further filter out incomes/expenses respectively

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to list entries by entering the following command:
```list [income|expense] [/from START_DATE] [/to END_DATE]```.

`Logic` invokes the `listHelper` method to create and execute the command to list the financial entries
according to the following logic:

![getArguments](UML/SeeAllEntriesGetArguments.png)

The above diagram details the parsing of the user command by InputParser, which returns a HashMap `commandArgumets`
containing the following optional arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the type of Financial Entries to be printed. Can take 3 possible values:
  - `expense`: List only Expenses
  - `income`: List only Incomes
  - `null`: List both Expenses and Incomes
- `/from`: Represents the starting date from which Financial Entries should be listed. If value is `null`,
  there is no defined starting date.
- `/to`: Represents the ending date by which Financial Entries should be listed. If value is `null`,
  there is no defined ending date.

The start/end dates, currently represented as strings, are parsed by `DateParser` to
obtain the start/end dates represented as `LocalDate`.

The diagram below then depicts the details of the execute command section in the previous diagram,
whereby `ListHelper` creates an instance of the corresponding command class, which then interacts with
the FinancialList to display the relevant entries.

![overview](UML/SeeAllEntriesCreateCommand.png)

The interaction between the command classes and `financialList` is as follows,
using `SeeAllEntriesCommand` as an example:

![execution](UML/SeeAllEntriesExecution.png)

`SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` work in a similar fashion,
but only marks `Expense`s and `Income`s respectively as to be included.

<ins>Usage Examples</ins>

```
// Listing all entries in the financial list
SeeAllEntriesCommand seeAllEntriesCommand = new SeeAllEntriesCommand(null, null);
seeAllEntriesCommand.execute(financialList);

// Listing all expenses starting from 12/10/24 in the financial list
SeeAllExpensesCommand seeAllExpensesCommand = new SeeAllExpensesCommand(DateParser.parse("12/10/24"), null);
seeAllExpensesCommand.execute(financialList);

// Listing all expenses starting from 12/10/24 until 24/10/24 in the financial list
SeeAllIncomesCommand seeAllIncomesCommand = new SeeAllIncomesCommand(DateParser.parse("12/10/24"), DateParser.parse("24/10/24"));
seeAllIncomesCommand.execute(financialList);
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

Given that the logic for `SeeAllEntriesCommand`, `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` are very similar 
with the only difference being the criteria for printing the entries, we made `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and 
`SeeAllIncomesCommand` inherit `SeeAllEntriesCommand` to reduce the amount of duplicated code written.

### Exceptions and Logging

An exception class `FinanceBuddyException` is thrown when users use the product wrongly.
Exceptions are caught at the nearest instance that they occur.

Logging is handled by the `Logger` class. 

### Storage

<ins>Overview</ins>

The `Storage` class has been implemented to store the `FinancialList` into a file. 
Also, it's responsible for restoring users' progress even if they have terminated the program using the saved file.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

 - Attributes:
   - `STORAGE_FILE_PATH`: `String` — Specifies the file path for storing financial data.

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

The function `updateStorage` should be called whenever the `FinancialList` in an `AppUi` object. 
It will override the `data/FinancialList.txt` file with the up-to-date `FinancialList` that has been converted to string.
Note: if the `data/FinancialList.txt` file doesn't exist, the program should generate one.

The storage format of an `Expense` or `Income`, handled by `toStorageString()` method is different from the format generate by `toString()` method for CLS display.

EX:
For an `Income` entry with description "Lunch," amount "10.90," date "2024/10/25," and category `FOOD`:
- The `toString()` method returns `[Income] - Lunch $10.90 (on 25/10/24) [FOOD]`
- The `toStorageString()` method returns `I | 10.90 | Lunch | 25/10/24 | FOOD`

For an `Expense` entry with description "Transport," amount "5.00," date "2024/10/25," and category `TRANSPORT`:
- The `toString()` method returns `[Expense] - Transport $5.00 (on 25/10/24) [TRANSPORT]`
- The `toStorageString()` method returns `E | 5.00 | Transport | 25/10/24 | TRANSPORT`

<ins>Methods</ins>

 - **getStorageFile()**: Ensures the storage file and its parent directories exist. If not, they are created. Returns the storage file.
 - **update(FinancialList theList)**: Writes all entries from FinancialList to the storage file, creating or overwriting the file with current entries. Logs the update upon completion.
 - **parseExpense(String[] tokens)**: Parses a string array into an Expense object. Expects tokens to contain amount, description, date, and category information.
 - **parseIncome(String[] tokens)**: Parses a string array into an Income object. Similar to parseExpense, it requires tokens for amount, description, date, and category.
 - **loadFromFile()**: Loads financial entries from the storage file into a FinancialList. Interprets each line as either an Expense or Income based on its starting character and parses the details accordingly.

<ins>Useage Example</ins>

```
Storage storage = new Storage("data/FinancialList.txt");

// Save the current financial list to a file
storage.update(financialList);

// Load the financial list from the file
FinancialList restoredList = storage.loadFromFile();
```

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

 - **Data Persistence**: Storage supports retention of records after application closure, aligning with needs for long-term financial tracking.
 - **Scalability**: Future improvements to Storage could incorporate encryption or remote storage options, enhancing data security and flexibility.
